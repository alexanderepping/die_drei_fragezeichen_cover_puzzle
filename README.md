Program to download, cut and arrange all covers of "Die drei Fragezeichen" audio books.

Original use is to print it to a puzzle, similar to [this original cover puzzle](https://www.rarepuzzles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_2606-1.jpg).
For that you should still add some text to the top and maybe the black spots at the bottom aswell.

It can be printed using the [Ravensburger "my Ravensburger Puzzle"](https://www.ravensburger.de/de-DE/produkte/fotoprodukte/my-ravensburger-fotopuzzle/my-ravensburger-puzzle-2000-teile-in-metalldose-82181).
